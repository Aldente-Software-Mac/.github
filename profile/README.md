## 🧹 Overview  

AlDente is a specialized macOS application designed to extend the longevity and efficiency of your MacBook battery. It gives users precise control over charging behavior, enabling them to maintain optimal battery health and reduce wear over time. By setting charge limits, AlDente helps prevent overcharging, which is one of the main causes of battery degradation in modern laptops.  

The app provides both basic and advanced modes, catering to casual users as well as professionals who want full control over battery management. In addition to customizable charge thresholds, AlDente supports monitoring tools that track battery cycles, current charge, temperature, and overall battery health metrics. These insights allow users to make informed decisions about usage patterns and charging schedules.  

AlDente seamlessly integrates with macOS, running quietly in the background while providing real-time notifications and easy access through the menu bar. It supports Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, ensuring smooth performance across different hardware generations. Users can also take advantage of automation features, such as automatic charge limits based on time of day or battery percentage, making battery management effortless.  

For professionals who rely on their MacBooks for long hours of work, AlDente ensures that battery performance remains consistent and predictable. By minimizing unnecessary charging cycles and monitoring temperature, the app helps reduce the risk of unexpected shutdowns and extends the lifespan of internal components. Its interface combines clarity with functionality, presenting complex data in an easy-to-understand visual layout.  

AlDente is not just a battery tool—it is a comprehensive utility for anyone looking to maximize MacBook efficiency and preserve hardware integrity over the long term. With this app, managing battery health becomes proactive rather than reactive, providing peace of mind and enhancing overall productivity.
